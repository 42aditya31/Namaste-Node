## 1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous in Node.js

### A. Pure Synchronous Example

```js
console.log("Hello World");

var a = 1078698;
var b = 20986;

function multiplyFn(x, y) {
  const result = a * b;
  return result;
}

var c = multiplyFn(a, b);

console.log("Multiplication result is : ", c);
```

#### Execution Flow:

1. The program logs `"Hello World"`.
2. It defines two variables `a` and `b`.
3. The function `multiplyFn` is invoked and executed synchronously.
4. The multiplication result is printed.
5. Each line is executed sequentially, and the thread is blocked until the operation completes.

#### Key Points:

* The execution is single-threaded.
* Each operation must complete before the next begins.
* There is no background or parallel processing.
* It is suitable for quick computations and control-flow-heavy logic but inefficient for I/O.

### B. Mixed Synchronous and Asynchronous Example

```js
const fs = require("node:fs");
const https = require("https");

console.log("Hello World");

var a = 1078698;
var b = 20986;

fs.readFileSync("./file.txt", "utf8");
console.log("This will execute only after file read");

https.get("https://dummyjson.com/products/1", (res) => {
  console.log("Fetched Data Successfully");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout called after 5 seconds");
}, 5000);

fs.readFile("./file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  console.log("File Data : ", data);
});

function multiplyFn(x, y) {
  const result = a * b;
  return result;
}

var c = multiplyFn(a, b);
console.log("Multiplication result is : ", c);
```

#### Execution Flow:

1. Logs `"Hello World"`.
2. `fs.readFileSync` blocks the main thread until the file is read.
3. Then, `"This will execute only after file read"` is printed.
4. Asynchronous tasks are scheduled:

   * `https.get` is passed to `libuv` and its callback is registered.
   * `setTimeout` is registered with a 5-second delay.
   * `fs.readFile` is queued and handed off to the thread pool.
5. The multiplication runs immediately.
6. Event loop later handles:

   * HTTP response callback
   * File read callback
   * setTimeout callback

#### Key Point:

* Sync functions block the event loop.
* Async functions allow non-blocking behavior using `libuv` and callbacks.

## 3. Blocking the Main Thread – CPU-bound Example

```js
const crypto = require("node:crypto");

console.log("Hello World");

crypto.pbkdf2Sync("password", "salt", 500, 50, "sha512");
console.log("First Key is Generated");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("call me right now !!!! ");
}, 0);

crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, key) => {
  console.log("Second Key is generated");
});

function multiplyFn(x, y) {
  const result = a * b;
  return result;
}

var c = multiplyFn(a, b);
console.log("Multiplication result is : ", c);
```

### Why `pbkdf2Sync` Blocks the Thread:

* The synchronous function executes on the main thread.
* While it is running, no other code (including `setTimeout`) can proceed.
* This delays the execution of all other tasks.
* In high-load applications, this can lead to poor scalability and response time.

### Preferred Alternative:

Use asynchronous versions like `pbkdf2` to offload to the thread pool.

---

## 4. `setTimeout(..., 0)` Explanation

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout executed");
}, 0);
```

### Behavior:

* Despite the delay being zero, it is placed in the task queue.
* The callback is not executed immediately.
* The event loop first completes the **current call stack**.
* Once the stack is empty, it pulls the callback from the task queue and executes it.

## 5. Summary: Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Feature         | Synchronous                  | Asynchronous                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Blocking        | Yes                          | No                                      |
| Multitasking    | No                           | Yes (via event loop and callback queue) |
| Execution Order | Top-to-bottom only           | Callback-based, event-driven            |
| Thread Usage    | Single thread                | Single thread + libuv thread pool       |
| Performance     | Poor with I/O or heavy tasks | High-performance and scalable           |

## 6. Internal Working – Execution Flow (Behind the Scenes)

**When executing Node.js code:**

1. **Main Thread (Call Stack):**

   * Executes synchronous code
   * Cannot process anything else while occupied

2. **Asynchronous APIs (via libuv):**

   * File system, networking, timers, etc.
   * These are registered and delegated to system-level APIs or thread pool

3. **libuv:**

   * Handles the registration and callback queue
   * When the async operation completes, it adds the callback to the **event loop**

4. **Event Loop:**

   * Continuously monitors the call stack and task queue
   * Executes queued callbacks when the call stack is empty

5. **Thread Pool (for CPU-bound work):**

   * Node uses a pool of threads (default size: 4)
   * Handles CPU-intensive work like encryption, compression, or DNS resolution
